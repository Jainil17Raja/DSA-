### Repo Creation for Groups of 2:


When setting up your repo please name your team as follows:

replace # with assignment number and your senecausernames as your seneca user names (without the @myseneca.ca part).
```
a# senecausername1 senecausername2
```

Thus, if you are creating a team for assignment 1 with team members were rkhojasteh and cleung

```
a1 rkhojasteh cleung
```


At the classroom page:

* Team member 1 fills out the form to create the repo using the usernames of both members
* Team member 2 waits till after team member one has done the previous step and simply hits the join button for their team.

When completed you will have a common repository named a#g2-a#-yournames
* the # will be replaced with assignment number
* the duplicate of a# is needed to distinquish later assignment teams
